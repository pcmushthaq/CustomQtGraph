This is a library which can be used to plot line graphs in QtQuick. A QML component is created in the library.

The API is similar to the QtCharts API. This is intended to be used for high performance applications. This uses SceneGraph APIs for plotting the graphs.

This is hardware accelarated.

Support for AreaChart is under development.
